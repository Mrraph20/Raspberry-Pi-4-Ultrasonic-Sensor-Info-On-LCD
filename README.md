# Displaying distance data from an ultrasonic sensor onto a LCD with the Raspberry Pi 4.
A project that periodically displays the distance data from an ultrasonic sensor to a LCD as "Dist: 0.00cm." 
For GPIO pin mapping, I used WiringPi (Made by Gordon Henderson under GNU-LGPL) to simplify. Link: http://wiringpi.com/

***WiringPi Note: The author has discontinued public releases of WiringPi. The last update was 2.52 for the Raspberry Pi 4B.***
Although WiringPi is preinstalled on Raspbian systems, the code for installation is as follows:
```
sudo apt-get install wiringpi
```
Hardware components used:
- (1) HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- (1) I2C LCD1602 Module
- (8) Male to Female Jumper Cables
- (1) Breadboard
- Raspberry Pi 4B Rev. 1.2

***Voltage Usage Note: The Raspberry Pi in this project is using the original power supply to support both 5V components. 
It is not recommended to use anything else since the Pi may not have enough voltage left over, causing restarts of the Pi.***

When compiling the code, run the following commands in terminal at the location of the file:
```
sudo bash
gcc UltrasonicSensorInfoOnLCD.c -o UltrasonicSensorInfoOnLCD -lwiringPi -lwiringPiDev
./UltrasonicSensorInfoOnLCD
```
This project was possible through an electronics kit I purchased from Freenove that provided me with all of the components I used. 
If interested, it is the "Freenove Ultrasonic Starter Kit for Raspberry Pi" (FNK0024).
